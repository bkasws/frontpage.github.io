<h2>Risk Factors - CoinList sale (14.06.2021)</h2>


<p>A PURCHASE OF TOKENS (THE “TOKENS”) INVOLVES A HIGH DEGREE OF RISK. PROSPECTIVE BUYERS SHOULD GIVE CAREFUL CONSIDERATION TO THE FOLLOWING RISK FACTORS IN EVALUATING THE MERITS AND SUITABILITY OF PURCHASING THE TOKENS. THE FOLLOWING DOES NOT PURPORT TO BE A COMPREHENSIVE SUMMARY OF ALL OF THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH A PURCHASE OF THE TOKENS. RATHER, THE FOLLOWING FACTORS ARE ONLY CERTAIN RISKS TO WHICH THE BUYER AND THE FOUNDATION ARE SUBJECT. PROSPECTIVE BUYERS SHOULD DISCUSS A POTENTIAL PURCHASE OF TOKENS IN DETAIL WITH THEIR PROFESSIONAL ADVISORS.  NO ONE SHOULD PURCHASE THE TOKENS WHO IS NOT PREPARED TO LOSE THE ENTIRETY OF HIS, HER OR ITS PRINCIPAL PURCHASE AMOUNT. CAPITALIZED TERMS USED BUT NOT DEFINED HEREIN SHALL HAVE THE MEANING ASCRIBED TO SUCH TERMS IN THE TOKEN PURCHASE AGREEMENT.</p>

<h3>I.  Buyer Risks </h3>

<em>You must be able to bear the loss of all of your purchase value.  </em>

<p>Swarm Network may contain cybersecurity vulnerabilities and/or code bugs that negatively impact or eliminate the value or functionality of the Tokens. Thus, Buyers are at risk that the Tokens they receive shall have limited or no value. </p>

<p>There is no assurance that any secondary market for Tokens will develop, or if a secondary market does develop, that it will remain in existence. Additionally, there are no guarantees that the Tokens will have any value, retain any value, increase in value, or receive any type of distribution of additional Tokens. Accordingly, the value of any purchase of Tokens may vary substantially over time and are subject to loss, including possible loss of the entire purchase amount. Accordingly, Buyers should only purchase the Tokens if they can afford to lose 100% of their purchase amount.  </p>

<em>There is no existing trading market for Tokens. </em> 

<p>Tokens are new digital assets for which there is no established public market. There can be no assurance that a secondary market will develop and, if a secondary market does develop, that it will provide the holders with liquidity or that it will continue for the life of Tokens. The liquidity of any market for Tokens will depend on a number of factors, including, but not limited: (i) the number of Tokens and Token holders; (ii) the performance of the Tokens; (iii) the market for similar digital assets; (iv) the interest of traders in making a market in Tokens; (v) regulatory developments in the digital token or cryptocurrency industries; and (vi) legal restrictions on transfer.  </p>

<em>Buyers will not have access to complete information regarding the Foundation, the Tokens or the Network.  </em>

<p>Buyers may not be able to obtain any or all of the information they would want regarding the Foundation, the Tokens or the Swarm Network, on a timely basis or at all. It is possible that a Buyer may not be aware on a timely basis of material adverse changes that have occurred which impact their purchase of Tokens. As a result of these limitations, a Buyer may not have accurate or complete information about the Foundation, the Tokens or the Swarm Network.  </p>

<em>Buyers need Independent Advice.  </em>

<p>The Foundation has consulted with counsel, accountants and other experts regarding the formation and operations of the Foundation, as well as the sale of Tokens. Each prospective Buyer should consult his own legal, tax, financial and technical advisors regarding the desirability of a purchase of Tokens.</p> 

<h3>II. Legal and Regulatory Risks </h3>

<em>The regulatory regime governing digital assets is still developing.  </em>

<p>The regulation of Tokens, the sale of digital assets in general, blockchain technologies, and digital asset exchanges is currently in an early stage, is likely to rapidly evolve, may vary significantly across jurisdictions, and is subject to significant uncertainty. Various legislative and executive bodies in various countries are currently considering, or may in the future consider, laws, regulations, guidance, or other actions, which may severely impact the Foundation and digital assets, including the Tokens. Failure by the Foundation to comply with any laws, rules and regulations, some of which may not exist yet or are subject to interpretation and may be subject to change, could result in a variety of adverse consequences. New or changing laws and regulations or interpretations of existing laws and regulations would likely have numerous adverse consequences, including, but not limited to: (i) Buyers’ ability to utilize the Token, (ii) the value of Tokens, (iii) the ability to transfer Tokens, (iv) the liquidity of the Tokens, and (v) Buyers’ ability to access marketplaces on which to trade Tokens. Therefore, there can be no assurance that any new or continuing regulatory scrutiny or initiatives will not have an adverse impact on the value of Tokens, or otherwise impede the Foundation’s activities.  </p>

<em>Application of Securities Laws to the Tokens. </em>

<p>The Foundation’s hypothesis in entering this Agreement is that Tokens will not be “securities” as defined by potentially applicable securities laws in a variety of jurisdictions, or, to the extent that they are securities, exemptions from registration under the securities laws may be available for use by the Foundation, or a compliance regime will be developed and implemented to make the operation of the Swarm Network fully compliant with applicable law. The Foundation will not sell the Tokens in jurisdictions in which the Tokens might be considered securities and where there is no available exemption from registration that allows the Foundation to sell the Tokens in that jurisdiction in a manner that allows the Tokens to be used by Buyers as intended.  Accordingly, residents of certain jurisdictions are prohibited from participating in the Token Sale, including residents of the United States.  </p>

<h3>III. Market Risks  </h3>

<em>Digital assets are volatile.  </em>

<p>The prices of digital assets change rapidly. Currently, there is relatively modest use of digital assets in the retail and commercial marketplace compared to use by speculators, which contributes to price volatility of digital assets. This volatility makes it difficult to use digital assets for ordinary, non-speculative transactions. Despite the Foundation’s intent to create a stable Digital Asset to be used on the Swarm platform, the price of digital assets may be affected by many factors outside the Foundation’s control such as supply and demand; mining incentives, availability and access to Digital Asset service providers (such as payment processors), exchanges, miners, node operators or other Digital Asset users and market participants; perceived or actual Swarm Network or instrument security vulnerability; changes in regulations, inflation levels; fiscal policy; monetary policy; political, natural and economic events, and many other factors. The volatility of digital assets generally could impede the adoption and demand for Tokens, which could negatively impact the assets of the Foundation and the value of Tokens.</p>  

<em>Purchases of any tokens, including the Tokens under this Agreement, involve a very high degree of risk. </em>

<p>The success of digital assets like the Tokens functionally depends on the level of adoption and use of the network to which they relate.  The market for new blockchain-based networks is crowded and highly competitive and the percentage of those networks (and related tokens and other digital assets) that survive and prosper will likely be small. For the Tokens to survive and have value, the Swarm Network may need to overcome unexpected problems in the areas of product development, marketing, financing, regulation, and general management, among others, which in many cases, may be difficult to accomplish and will depend on the level of engagement from the community of Swarm Network users.  Buyers should not rely on the Swarm Foundation to promote the Swarm Network or take steps to grow the value or market price of the Tokens. </p>

<h3>IV. Operational Risks  </h3>

<em>Risks Involved with Creation of a New Distributed Ledger Swarm Network and Ecosystem.  </em>

<p>The Tokens and the Swarm Network rely on new, unproven technology. The Swarm Network, even if successfully developed and maintained, may not garner sufficient user interest such that the Swarm Network is sustainable. </p>

<em>The digital asset market is extremely competitive, and other networks have been and may be developed that are the same or similar to the Swarm Network. </em>

<p>The Foundation is developing technology in a highly competitive and increasingly saturated industry. It is possible that competitive networks could be established that utilize the same or similar open source code and protocol underlying the Swarm Network and attempt to implement services that are materially similar to the Tokens. The Swarm Network may be forced to compete with these competitive networks, which could negatively impact the adoption of the Tokens, which would likely adversely impact the value of the Foundation and the Tokens. </p>

<em>The Foundation may be forced to cease operations or take actions that result in a dissolution event. </em> 

<p>It is possible that, due to any number of reasons, including, but not limited to, an unfavourable fluctuation in the value of digital assets or fiat currencies, the inability by the Foundation to establish a viable financial ecosystem for the Tokens’ utility, the failure of commercial relationships, regulatory issues, or intellectual property ownership challenges, the Foundation may no longer be viable to operate, and may dissolve or take actions that result in a dissolution event.  </p>

<em>The Foundation may be subject to litigation and other claims.</em>  

<p>The Foundation, as an independent legal entity, may be subject to lawsuits or proceedings initiated by government entities or private parties, which could entail expenses and liabilities borne by the Foundation.  </p>

<em>The Foundation may be accused of infringing intellectual property rights of third parties.</em>

<p>The Foundation or the Swarm Network may be subject to claims of alleged infringement of the intellectual property rights of third parties. Such claims, even if not meritorious, may result in significant expenditure of financial and managerial resources, payment of damages or settlement amounts, and reduced confidence in the Swarm Network’s viability and the ability of users to hold, use and transfer the Tokens. Additionally, the Foundation may become subject to injunctions prohibiting it from using software, business processes, trademarks or other intellectual property that it currently uses or may need to use in the future, or requiring the Foundation to obtain licenses from third parties when such licenses may not be available on terms feasible or acceptable to the Foundation. </p>

<em>There are other risks associated with developing a new technology. </em>

<p>The Swarm Network will use new technology. There are no guarantees that such technology will be bug-free or accepted by the marketplace. Thus, the Tokens may be subject to the risk of theft, loss, malfunction, or reputational risk, any of which can significantly degrade its value.
</p>

<em>The open-source nature of the Swarm Network protocol means that the Swarm Network may be susceptible to developments by users or contributors which could damage the Swarm Network and Foundation’s reputation and could affect the utilization of the Swarm Network and the Tokens. </em>

<p>The Swarm Network will operate based on an open-source protocol maintained by Foundation and other contributors. As an open-source project, the Swarm Network will not be represented, maintained or monitored by an official organization or authority. The open-source nature of the Swarm Network protocol means that it may be difficult for the Company or contributors to maintain or develop the Swarm Network and the Foundation may not have adequate resources to address emerging issues or malicious programs that develop within the Swarm Network adequately or in a timely manner. Third parties not affiliated with the Foundation may introduce weaknesses or bugs into the core infrastructure elements of the Swarm Network and open-source code which may negatively impact the Swarm Network. Such events may result in a loss of trust in the security and operation of the Swarm Network and a decline in user activity and could negatively impact the market price of the Tokens.</p>

<em>There are risks relating to cybersecurity. </em>

<p>The Foundation utilizes a substantial amount of electronic information. This includes transaction information and sensitive personal information of the Buyers. The service providers used by the Foundation, may also use, store, and transmit such information. The Foundation intends to implement detailed cybersecurity policies and procedures and an incident response plan designed to protect such information and prevent data loss and security breaches. However, such measures cannot provide absolute security. Breach of the Foundation’s information systems may cause information relating to the transactions of the Foundation and sensitive Buyer information be compromised to unauthorized third-parties.  </p>

<em>There are risks relating to privacy.  </em>

<p>The Foundation may be compelled to disclose personal information about a Buyer or multiple Buyers to federal or state government regulators or taxation authorities. Accordingly, certain information concerning Buyers may be shared outside of the Foundation. </p>


<h3>V. Risks Specific to Tokens  </h3>

<em>Destruction of Tokens.  </em>

<p>Tokens are intended to be accessible only by a party who possesses both the unique public and private keys relating to the local or online digital wallet in which such Tokens are held. To the extent private keys holding the Foundation’s or Buyers’ Tokens are lost, destroyed or otherwise compromised, neither the Foundation nor the Buyer may be able to access the related Tokens. Any loss of private keys relating to digital wallets used to store the Foundation’s Tokens could adversely affect the Foundation. Further, Tokens are typically transferred digitally, through electronic media not controlled or regulated by any entity. To the extent a Token is transferred erroneously to the wrong destination, the Buyer may be unable to recover the Tokens or its value. Such loss could adversely affect the Foundation and result in a complete loss of the Buyer’s Tokens. </p>

<em>Token Transactions are Generally Irrevocable. </em>

<p>One of the values of distributed ledger and blockchain technology is that they create a permanent, public record of Token transactions. The potential drawback to this, however, is that even if a transaction turns out to have been in error, or as a result of theft of Tokens, such a transaction is not reversible. Consequently, the Foundation is unable to replace missing Tokens or seek reimbursement for any erroneous transfer or theft of Tokens. To the extent that the Foundation is unable to seek redress for such action, error or theft, such loss could adversely affect the Foundation. Additionally, Buyers may lose all of their Tokens if a transaction was made in error or if the Tokens were stolen. </p>  

<em>Bad Actors or Hackers. </em> 
<p>
Bad Actors or Hackers may launch attacks to steal, compromise, or secure Tokens, such as by attacking Swarm Network source code, exchange servers, third-party platforms, cold and hot storage locations or software, or Token or Token transaction history, or by other means. As the Swarm Network increases in size, it may become a more appealing target of hackers, malware, cyber-attacks or other security threats. An attack or a breach of security could result in a loss of private data, unauthorized trades, an interruption of the Swarm Network for an extended period of time, violation of applicable privacy and other laws, significant legal and financial exposure, damage to reputation, and a loss of confidence in security measures, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Foundation and the value of Tokens. Any such attack or breach could adversely affect the ability of the Foundation to operate, which could indirectly adversely affect the value of the Tokens. Any breach of data security that exposes or compromises the security of any of the private digital keys used to authorize or validate transactions, or that enables any unauthorized person to generate any of the private digital keys, could result in unauthorized transactions and would have a material adverse effect on the Foundation and potentially the value of Tokens. The Foundation will undertake efforts to secure and safeguard the Tokens in its custody from theft, loss, damage, destruction, malware, hackers or cyber-attacks, which may add significant expenses to the operation of the Foundation. There can be no assurance that such security measures will be effective. Additionally, there exists the possibility that while acquiring or disposing of Tokens, the Foundation unknowingly engages in transactions with bad actors who are under the scrutiny of government investigative agencies. As such, the Foundation' systems or a portion thereof may be taken off-line pursuant to legal process such as the service of a search and/or seizure warrant on the Foundation. Such action could result in the loss of Tokens previously under the Foundation's control.  </p>

<em>Digital assets, including Tokens are subject to manipulation. </em> 

<p>Bad actors can use a number of manipulative trading strategies such as spoofing, wash trading and trading in coordination with other bad actors to artificially influence the price of digital assets. Bad actors can also attack one or more Digital Asset exchanges. If an exchange is taken offline, it would likely result in reduced liquidity making it easier to manipulate price of one or more digital assets. It is possible that one or more actors may manipulate the price of Token and/or the Tokens, which may adversely impact the value of the Buyer's Tokens.</p>

<em>Accounting and Taxation Risk.  </em>

<p>The tax characterization of Tokens, as well as the consequences of using Tokens is uncertain. It is possible that jurisdictions will levy substantial or prohibitive taxes on Tokens, thus greatly devaluing them. All potential Buyers should consult with their own tax advisors on the consequences of purchasing the Tokens. </p>
