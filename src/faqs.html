            <div id="what-is-the-relationship-between-swarm-and-ethereum" class="collapse answer">
              <p>Swarm started in the first days of Ethereum as part of the original “world computer” vision, consisting of Ethereum (the processor), Whisper (messaging) and Swarm (storage). The project is the result of years of research and work by
                the Ethereum Foundation, the Swarm Foundation, teams, individuals across the ecosystem and the community.
              </p>
              <p>The conceptual idea for Swarm was started in the Ethereum team at the beginning, and the Ethereum Foundation incubated Swarm. After five years of research, Swarm and Ethereum are now two separate entities.</p>

            <div id="what-is-the-proof-of-data-exchange-between-your-node-and-the-queen-node" class="collapse answer">
              <p>The proof of data exchange between your node and trusted node is the value of the cheques you cashed from the trusted node (qBZZ).</p>
              <p>At the end of the airdrop, we will simply run a script and collect all the value of the cheques originating from trusted nodes which are cashed out. The more cashed out qBZZ cheques you received, the more BZZ tokens you will receive.
                It’s not the number of cheques, but the gBZZ value in the exchange. You only need to cash out cheques every once (we advice doing cashouts on a regular basis, like once a week) in a while and make sure you cash out all of them just
                before the airdrop ends and we switch to mainnet.</p>

            <div id="how-many-tokens-will-you-get" class="collapse answer">
              <p>We are handing out exactly 1,000,000 BZZ tokens. The value of qBZZ is not yet determined, as this depends on the network traffic.</p>
              <p><strong>Example: </strong><br>At the end of the airdrop, 500k worth of qBZZ cheques were collected from all the nodes in the network. In this case, one qBZZ token is worth: 1M BZZ divided by 500k = 2 BZZ tokens per qBZZ token.</p>
              <p>So, if your node collected 50 worth of qBZZ cheques, you would receive 50 x 2BZZ = 100 BZZ tokens. If you ran 3 nodes and they collected 50 worth of qBZZ cheques each, then that is 300 BZZ from the airdrop.</p>

              <p>We will announce the airdrop end date so you will have time to cashout.</p>
              <p>We advice doing cashouts on a regular basis, like once a week > if your node has crashed and you have lost the keypair, you won’t be able to recover the cheques.</p>

              <p>This is important — as the airdrop concludes, you will need to cash out your qBZZ cheques. Without this, you will not receive your BZZ tokens once we hit mainnet.</p>
              <p>You are strongly advised to join the bee-support channel, our Discord server, or closely follow our social media channels so you don’t miss this tutorial.</p>

            <div id="what-is-the-extra-airdrop-about" class="collapse answer">
              <p>The purpose of the airdrop is to reward node operators who helped run the testnet, but more importantly to get as many nodes as possible BZZ to use on the Swarm network. For this reason, additional funds to the airdrop budget were
                added to airdrop all nodes that deployed a chequebook and cashed out at least one cheque with a non-zero value with 0.1BZZ. This amount is more than enough for you to start trying out the Swarm main network.</p>

              <p>You don’t need to do this. Your BZZ (called xBZZ) has the most utility on xDAI, as this is where it can be used to upload and download content to and from the Swarm network. You can also transfer your funds to the Ethereum mainnet.

              <p>The airdrop mechanism was designed to reward real node operators, who contributed their hardware to the Swarm network. Just by looking at the blockchain, you cannot know whether the transaction emanated because the node was
                participating in the Swarm economy or not. The trusted nodes were chosen, such that it is likely that they were truly participating in the Swarm economy.</p>

            <div id="i-never-got-any-cheques-can-i-have-some-bzz" class="collapse answer">
              <p>The rewards go to those nodes that proved to actively participate in the economy of the Swarm test network--deployed a chequebook and cashed out at least one cheque. If this does not apply to you, you unfortunately don’t get any BZZ

              <p>The Swarm project belongs to the cypherpunk movement. As a result, Swarm has strong principles. One of those is believing in the absence of lockups or any other unnecessary restriction of freedom, within the bounds of regulatory
                possibilities. </p>

              <p>P2p storage and messaging predates blockchain. Swarm started in the first days of Ethereum as part of the original “world computer” vision. The project is the result of years of research and work by the Ethereum Foundation, the Swarm
                Foundation, and teams and individuals across the ecosystem and the community. Even so, this is just the beginning of the road towards a fully decentralised and fair web.</p>

              ‘bzzhash’). You can also use QR codes. You can share the web link with anyone to let them download your file. If you’re familiar with Swarm, you can use the Swarm hash.</div>

            <div id="whats-a-swarm-hash-how-do-i-use-it" class="collapse answer">The Swarm hash (or ‘bzzhash’) is the unique ID of your file on the Swarm network. It’s a 64 or 128 hex character string. In the Gateway, you can go to the ‘Access’ page
              and paste a Swarm hash to access the corresponding file. You can also access files that were not uploaded through the Gateway.</div>

            <div id="why-do-i-get-the-file-not-found-error" class="collapse answer">Sometimes, even if you have used a correct web link or Swarm hash, you may see the ‘File not found’ error. There are two main reasons for that. This could be because
              the file is not yet available on the network or because it has expired. After uploading, the file will need some time to propagate on the network. If you have just uploaded the file, you might just need to wait a little bit. If the file
              has expired, it’s unfortunately no longer available on the network. Please keep in mind that this service is provided for testing purposes only, there’s no guarantee about file availability on the Swarm Gateway.</div>
